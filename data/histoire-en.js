The Idaksahak community, known for its piety, strictly follows Sunni Islam of the Maliki school. Religious scholars (cadis and learned men) from this community provide spiritual, educational, and social leadership, sometimes in rivalry with Kel Essouk ideologues. Quranic education is free and widespread. As a deeply Muslim people, the Idaksahak reject raids and promote non-violence, religious knowledge, and peace as core identity values.

Several traditions mention descent from the Goudala or from Fatimat, daughter of the Prophet. Some still possess Idrissid genealogical trees. They are also considered descendants of Aïta (Moamed El Moktar), a founding figure in various regions of Gao and Kidal. Despite hypotheses of an Israelite origin, the community strongly affirms its Muslim identity. Source: Summary from the study by Ahmed Mohamed AG GUIDI.",

Each group is led by a customary or religious leader and sometimes a war chief. This structure also integrates lineages of scholars, artisans, and assimilated groups from other peoples. The hierarchy is based on religious knowledge, noble behavior, and adherence to Islamic principles. Alliances between fractions promote peace and regional cooperation.

Their internal organization, based on solidarity, adherence to Islamic law, and a culture of peace, enabled them to resist assimilation. Rejecting raids and rezzous deemed immoral, they favored peaceful mediation while defending their assets when necessary. Their religious knowledge, strategic geographic position, and linguistic uniqueness often made them intermediaries in local conflicts.

    "contenu": "Despite a long history of involvement in local resistance dynamics, the Idaksahak have often been sidelined from dominant narratives and major political decisions. Their collective memory retains the sacrifices during the 1990s conflicts, which were little acknowledged during ex-combatant integrations. Confined to unstable border areas, they had to self-organize for security. Their ambiguous position in the Tuareg hierarchy often places them among the dominated, even though they possess recognized cultural, religious, and economic autonomy. This marginal status is also reflected in limited access to state services, reinforcing their sense of exclusion despite their consistent loyalty to regional stability.
